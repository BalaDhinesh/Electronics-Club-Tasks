# Crowd Detection Camera
## Description:
We use RPi with a camera for capturing live video.The video is then processed frame by frame.By using image processing with the help of TensorFlow in Python, people and vehicles in the video are identified.
It can be used to 
- Detect high traffic on roads
- Identify any unauthorised human entry in a restricted area.
- Observe the number of people in a hall/auditorium.
- Maintain and monitor the flow of the crowd in a protest.
