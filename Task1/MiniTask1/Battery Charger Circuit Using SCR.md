# Battery Charger Circuit Using SCR
## Decription:
The AC source is given to the step down transformer which converts the large AC source into limited AC source, filter the AC voltage and remove the noise and then give that voltage to the SCR(Silicon Controlled Rectifier) where it will rectify the AC and give the resulting voltage to the battery for charging.
