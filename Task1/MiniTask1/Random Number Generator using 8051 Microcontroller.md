# Random Number Generator using 8051 Microcontroller
## Project Description:

This project generates a random number in between 0 to 100 when a push button is pressed.In this, the counter is incremented from 0 to 99 at a high speed. If you press the button, then the LCD displays the current count value. As the count is incrementing at a high speed, the 8051 Microcontroller selects a random number when button is pressed.Then a program in written for Random number generation using Keil software for generating hex file inorder to upload into the 8051 microcontroller.
