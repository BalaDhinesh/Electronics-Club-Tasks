Maze is a type of puzzle with start start and end points including many dead ends.To solve this puzzle we need to find right path in a fastest possible way.This project requires line maze which is black line on a white background.Â Sensors are used which helps robot to find its path and keeps it updated about the line on the floor.We also decide rules such like left/right hand side rule when there is an intersection.Robot should also store information about Dead ends and Bad turns.


The robot is built using microcontroller AT89C51 (used as the decision-making device), motor driver L293D, operational amplifier LM324 (comparator), phototransistor (sensor) and a few discrete components.
