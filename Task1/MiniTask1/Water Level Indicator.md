# Water Level Indicator
## Description:
The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.
The sensing is done by using a set of nine probes which are placed at nine different levels on the tank walls. The level 8 represents the “tank full” condition while level 0 represents the “tank empty” condition.
This conducting medium water with the probe causes the base-emitter junction of transistor to get forward biased, this switches transistor from cut-off to conduction mode
