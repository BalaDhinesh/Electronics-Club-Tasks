# Soil Moisture Tester

## Components Required:

- Soil moisture sensor
- Small BreadBoard
- 3*330 ohm resistors
- red,yellow,green led
- jumper wires
- Arduino uno

## Description:
Soil moisture sensor is used to measure ground conductivity.Arduino is used to create some levels of soil moisture.LEDâ€™s are used to show the levels of moisture.
The Soil Moisture Sensor uses capacitance to measure dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium. In soil, dielectric permittivity is a function of the water content. The sensor averages the water content over the entire length of the sensor.
