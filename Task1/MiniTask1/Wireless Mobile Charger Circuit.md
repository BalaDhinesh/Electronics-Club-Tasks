# Wireless Mobile Charger Circuit

## Description:
This circuit mainly works on the principle of mutual inductance.It uses two circuits transmitter circuit(used to produce voltage wirelessly) and receiver circuit(AC power is induced in the coil).
Thus we can remove wires for charging. This circuit may be used as wireless power transfer circuit, wireless mobile charger circuit, wireless battery charger circuit, etc.
