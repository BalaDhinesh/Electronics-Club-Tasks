# Improved UV Sterilizer for Masks

## Components Required:

- UV-C sterilizer lamp(for generating UV rays)
- dc gearmotor 12V(for rotating the jar)


## Description:

It is a device that would relaibly kill the corona virus anywhere on the surface of masks.This system uses a Ball Jar , with modified end caps, to contain a mask or other sterilizer payload on a roller system. The jar rotates directly under the UV lamp at an adjustable speed. This allows for prolonged, close-range exposure to UV-C light, which is proven to disrupt the DNA of viruses and destroy their ability to infect people.
