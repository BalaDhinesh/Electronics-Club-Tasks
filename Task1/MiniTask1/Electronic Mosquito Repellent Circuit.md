# Electronic Mosquito Repellent Circuit
## Description:
Mosquitoes have the ability to hear ultrasonic sounds and this feature is attributed to the presence of sensory structures in their antenna.Mosquitoes have the ability to hear ultrasonic sounds and this feature is attributed to the presence of sensory structures in their antenna.This ultrasound produces a stress on the antennae of the mosquitoes and repels them away.So this circuit is designed to produce ultrasound in the frequency range of 20 kHz to 38 kHz.The basic idea behind developing the circuit is to use a buzzer to produce ultrasound. The buzzer is driven by an oscillator circuit. Here, we are using a 555 Timer based astable multivibrator circuit as the oscillator circuit.

This can also be used for other insects as a repellant by changing the values of resistors and capacitor.
