# Battery Level Indicator

## Description:
The heart of this battery level indicator circuit is LM3914 IC(suitable for indicating 12V battery level). This IC takes input analog voltage and drives 10 LEDâ€™s linearly according to the input analog voltage.
We can use this circuit to check car battery or inverter. So by using this circuit, we can increase the lifetime of battery.
