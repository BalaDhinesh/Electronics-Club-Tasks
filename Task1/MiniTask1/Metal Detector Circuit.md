# Metal Detector Circuit

## Description:
TDA0161 is a Proximity Detector IC used to detect metal objects by detecting the slight changes in the high frequency Eddy current losses.The metal object has to be at a distance of 10mm for the detector to detect it.This simple Metal Detector can be used to identify metals like iron, gold, silver etc.
