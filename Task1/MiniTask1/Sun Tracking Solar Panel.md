# Sun Tracking Solar Panel
## Description
The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent.This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun.This can be implemented by two LDRs, solar panel and a servo motor and ATmega328 Micro controller.
Light Dependent Resistors produce low resistance when light falls on them.Servo motor helps to rotate the panel in the direction of Sun.Panel is arranged in such a way that light on two LDRs is compared and panel is rotated towards LDR which have high intensity i.e. low resistance compared to other with the help of microcontroller.
