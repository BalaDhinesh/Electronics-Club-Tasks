# Speed Control of DC Motor Using Pulse Width Modulation
## Description:
This method works by driving the motor with a series of “ON-OFF” pulses and varying the duty cycle, the fraction of time that the output voltage is “ON” compared to when it is “OFF”, of the pulses while keeping the frequency constant.
In this method, the power loss is small because the transistor is either fully “ON” or fully “OFF”. As a result the switching transistor has a much reduced power dissipation giving it a linear type of control which results in better speed stability.


We use an Astable 555 Oscillator to produce a pulse width modulation signal to control the motor.
