# Arduino Currency Counter using IR and Color Sensor
## Description:
From this project, we can count the paper currency notes and calculate their amount, by sensing the paper currency using Color Sensor and Arduino.TCS230 color sensor is used for detecting the currency notes and, Arduino UNO for processing the data and showing the remaining balance on 16x2 LCD.
TCS230 sensor has inbuilt infrared LEDs that are used to light up the object whose colour is to be detected. This ensures that there will no impacts of external surrounding light on the object. This sensor reads a photodiode of 8*8 array, which comprises of 16 photodiodes with red filters, 16 with blue filters, 16 with green filters and 16 photodiodes without any filter. 
We have to set the frequency conditions in the Arduino Code for various currencies.
## Required Components:
- Arduino UNO
- TCS230 Colour sensor
- IR sensor
- Breadboard
- 16*2 Alphanumeric LCD
- Connecting Wires
