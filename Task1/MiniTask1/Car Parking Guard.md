# Car Parking guard Using Infrared Sensor
## Description:
This project aims to help the car driver by giving an alarm if there is any obstacle or a wall while parking or driving in reverse.
We use IR Sensor to detect an obstacle within 100cm range.If there is an obstacle it produces sound by generating a buzzer sound by PWM using LM555 timer operating in astable multivibrator mode.
Tone Detector LM567 is used to set the cutoff frequency to sound the buzzer after the cutoff frequency reaches.
Every car have reverse indicator supply which can be given to the 7805 Voltage Regulator to give 5volt for ciruit to start functioning.
