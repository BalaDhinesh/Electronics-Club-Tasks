# GSM Based Home Security Alarm System
## Description:
This project is a very efficient home security that has a function of calling the homeowner on his/her mobile number in case of an intruder alert.


The project is based on Arduino, PIR motion detection sensor and GSM Module.The GSM Module communicates with the microcontroller in a serial manner.SIM 900A is the GSM/GPRS module with built in RS232 interface. It has dual band GSM/GPRS system that works on 900/1800MHz frequencies.

With the help of RS232, the modem can be connected to PC or microcontroller via serial cable. Voice calls, SMS and internet access are possible with this module.
